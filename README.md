# ICD-10-PCS-code-Medical-Procedures
This project processes and unifies two public datasets from the HCUP and CDC to create a clean, analysis-ready dimension table of all US medical procedure codes (ICD-10-PCS). The process involves data cleaning, handling complex string fields, merging datasets, and adding a surrogate key for optimal integration into a star schema data model.
